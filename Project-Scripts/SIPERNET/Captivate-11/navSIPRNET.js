The Secretary of the Army and Vice Chief of Staff have directed the internal Army investigations be conducted by commanders, directors, and section leaders with their senior noncommissioned officers. They also directed them to immediately spot-check SIPRNET security training. This directive is not intended to slight the security and information technology departments, but rather to emphasize the seriousness of the security breach, and that the protection of classified and sensitive, but unclassified information is everyone’s responsibility.

For the purposes of this SIPRNET security refresher, we can classify the potential threat against MEDCOM and the MEDCOM SIPRNET communications backbone into four distinct areas: The intelligence services of a hostile or adversary state, such as Iran or North Korea which come quickly to mind. The intelligence services or commercial interests of a “friendly-competitor” state, and France and Israel serve as useful examples in this case. A U.S. person or persons attempting to compromise or steal classified information for ideological reasons, which can be difficult for loyal and law-abiding Americans to understand, or for criminal financial reasons, is a third category; Aldridge Ames, Robert Hanssen, and Army Private First Class Bradley Manning come quickly to mind.

SECRET is a medium level of security classification and is the “typical” level for sensitive doctrine and procedures for regular military action such as orders for troop movement and even “normal” combat operations, after action reports from conventional combat action, resource inventories of Soldiers, other personnel, and multiple classes of supply, and communications between MEDCOM and regional command or subordinate command units, responding to HQDA taskers, medical research, surety, and CBRN events.",

They should be treated as high-value, unclassified items.  Similar to CACs, SIPRNET tokens contain three individual public key infrastructure certificates used for identity verification, digitally signing email, and encrypting e-mail.  The PKI credentials encoded in the microchip of the SIPRNET token are protected by a PIN; not a password.  When inserted into the SIPRNET card reader and unlocked with the user PIN, the token is classified.  Never leave a token inserted into the card reader/workstation unattended. The 8-16 digit numeric PIN is chosen by and known only to the token holder.  Users will not carry their PINs on their person or share them with others.  PINs should be memorized to maintain the security of the network.  A PIN is not required to be changed unless it has been compromised.

Damaged, lost, or stolen tokens should immediately be reported to the local IASO.  For lost/stolen tokens, the IASO should initiate certificate revocation and token reissuance.  This action renders the lost/stolen card useless to anyone who may find it or try to use it for illicit purposes. Ms. Thomas will probably be counseled on her failure to properly safeguard her token.

The conduct of a preliminary investigation usually goes quite rapidly. However, if it is judged that there was a possible or actual loss of classified information—with potential damage to national security—another extensive investigation is triggered which is beyond the scope of this refresher training.

If the unauthorized access was by a person with the appropriate security clearance, but without the need to know, a formal debriefing is usually unnecessary. This is a decision for the organization’s commanding officer working with the counsel of the security manager. However, if the unauthorized access was by U.S. government personnel, whether civilian or military, without the appropriate security clearance, a formal debriefing will be accomplished. If the person who had unauthorized access is an employee of a cleared contractor participating in the national industrial security program, the same guidelines apply as for U.S. government personnel.",

In another case: A Soldier printed award paperwork which was classified “SECRET,” then scanned the document, and emailed it to over 30 individuals on the NIPRNET.

Within MEDCOM, transferring any data from a SIPRNET computer to an unclassified system is prohibited. Another security concern is spyware, software that is secretly or surreptitiously installed into an information system to gather information on individuals or organizations without their knowledge; it is a type of malicious code. The three most common means of entering this code on a communications or information system are by the use of an unauthorized removable media storage device, entering a prohibited website, or through opening a contaminated attachment.

Destruction methods include burning, crosscut shredding, wet pulping, melting, mutilation, chemical decomposition, and pulverizing. The general rule is all documents or material associated with SIPRNET use are classified, and therefore should not be put in the normal trash. All sensitive waste must be shredded using a National Security Agency (NSA) approved cross-cut high security shredder. These modern shredders “grind or pulverize” the documents so finely that even a determined adversary or competitor could not recreate our classified products.
