  "No Narration",
  "Have you ever decided to pick up the lawnmower and carry it around on your back...while it's still running? Let's hope not. That could qualify you for one of those Darwin awards, and that's the kind of fame you really don't need.  Have you ever wondered how the Army does large-scale operations, like treating a few HUNDRED uniforms with permethrin, in areas where large equipment isn't practical?  A few hundred aerosol cans might do the job -- maybe...",
  "Have you ever gone to a rock concert and jammed your head into an on-stage amplifier?  If so, you have a good idea of the dangers of high-volume noise. Have you ever started a job using hand tools, and then started wishing you had a nice POWER tool to help you get done?  If so, you'll understand the principle behind the Army's backpack sprayer. ",
  "Take a moment to look at the lesson objectives.",
  "Liza actually enjoys using a one or two gallon sprayer, but the Army's gasoline-powered backpack sprayer gives her the willies -- if you'll excuse the pun. This is NOT the backpack that you might have used in your garden. Comparing the Army's backpack sprayer to this old-fashioned, civilized device is like comparing a poodle to a pit bull! Plus, it just looks too much like that pain-in-the-neck robot from the Medieval-Era TV show \"Lost in Space.\"",
  "For one thing, the military back-pack sprayer is powered, and not by your \"sort of strong\" right arm. This beast maintains pressure by means of a 2-cycle gasoline engine that generates between three and four horsepower, more than Willie's right arm could generate in the next decade. You might also notice that this engine could easily power most of the lawnmowers parked in suburban garages...that's a lot of power to carry around on your back, and a lot of weight as well. The machine weighs 24 pounds empty, and  once that 3.6 gallon pesticide tank is full, it's a hefty 54 pounds of noise, heat and raw force.",
  " ",
  "For another thing, there's the NOISE! You already know, or SHOULD know, that ear plugs are a necessity when you're mowing the grass. Lawn mowers are just super loud...even louder than Willie's attempts to sing La Traviata, which he does no matter how much people beg him to stop. Now try to imagine carrying this same lawnmower engine on your back! When I tell you that ear plugs are a necessity, I'm understating the facts.",
  "Another backpack sprayer issue is the heat generated by that powerful gasoline engine. If you've ever inadvertently touched a motorcycle exhaust pipe, like boyhood Willie once decided to do in a moment of lunacy, you probably recall a moment of excruciating agony and the sounds of your own glass-shattering scream. Now imagine upping the ante by carrying that insanely hot engine on your back-clever, huh?",
  "The backpack sprayer runs on gasoline, a fuel that Liza considers the last word in safety and stability, especially in a deployed environment...PSYCHE!! Only someone from the planet ZIMBLATT would imagine that gasoline is safe and stable. Did you know that gasoline releases an ignitable vapor at the frigid temperature of minus 45 degrees centigrade? Did you know that an atmosphere with only 1 point 4 percent gasoline vapor is considered explosive? Did you know that exploding gasoline produces temperatures of around 15 THOUSAND degrees Fahrenheit? Did you know that one gallon of gasoline is as explosive as 20 sticks of dynamite? Apparently you DIDN'T!",
  "So, with all this in mind, you're probably wondering why the Army continues to use a backpack sprayer that everyone admits is loud, has dangerously superheated surfaces, uses a volatile and explosive fuel, and sometimes actually catches on fire! The answer is simple...this is one powerful machine. An operator using the backpack sprayer can do more work in a few hours than someone using manual equipment could do in a couple of days.  When you want to do large-scale pesticide application, using a manually carried machine, this is the only real choice.",
  " ",
  "Well, it's time to stop talking about the backpack sprayer, and start taking a look. Liza tells her reluctant students to get up and come closer...closer...until finally they're standing right in front of the actual machine. It's time for an anatomy lesson. The backpack sprayer consists of several parts, the engine and all its controls like throttle and choke, the pesticide tank, and the delivery apparatus. We'll start by looking at the engine.",
  " As you know, this sprayer is powered by a two-cycle gasoline engine of at least 3 horsepower. The engine drives a fan unit that disperses liquid or solid pesticides, and also pressurizes any liquid that's placed in the chemical tank. Looking at the back of the sprayer, you can see the engine, the choke lever and the starter grip. A couple of engine controls, the throttle and on/off switch, are located far away from the actual engine, on the control arm.",
  "To start the engine, we'll first make sure it's fueled up. The fuel tank, which holds 50 fluid ounces, or one and a half liters, is located at the base of the sprayer, underneath the engine itself. Two-cycle engines don't have an oil reservoir like your four-cycle car engine, so you'll mix the oil directly into the fuel.  The fuel is a mix of 50 parts gasoline with 1 part of two-cycle motor oil. REMEMBER, only oil designed for air-cooled two-cycle engines will do, not that medieval can of mystery oil you have lying around the shop. It's best to use the oil designed by the manufacturer for that specific engine. To mix up fuel, add one gallon of gasoline to 2.6 ounces of oil. Do this in a separate fuel can, cap the container and shake it like a Polaroid picture. You're ready to add fuel. By the way, this mixture of gasoline and oil is like a martini, it should be used while it's fresh. Don't mix up any more fuel than you'll use in a day or so.",
  "Adding fuel is a simple process that even Willie could manage, IF he didn't have that rotator cuff injury from pitching in the 1904 World Series. First, clean around the filler cap so you don't mix dirt with fuel, then loosen the cap. If the machine has been used recently, open the cap s-l-o-w-l-y to release any residual pressure from the fuel tank. Now fill it up. Don't breathe the gasoline fumes or get fuel on your skin, and don't commit suicide by smoking or working near ignition sources. Put the cap back on and tighten it up securely. Reseal the fuel can and store it safely in a flammable cabinet.",
  "Now let's think a minute. Gasoline engines run on fuel, and air. Make sure the machine can get the air it needs to run. Check the air intakes and clean out any blockages. Look at the air filter and clean it if necessary. The manufacturer can provide a nice screen to keep dirt out of the air intake and make cleaning a lot easier. The engine will also need a spark, so make sure the spark plug is installed and the spark plug wire is connected.",
  "Did you forget anything? Well, ask yourself what might happen when the engine is started. When the engine runs, pesticide starts flowing whether you're ready to start or not. Locate the stopcock that regulates pesticide flow, it's located at the lower left side of the control handle. Turn the stopcock to a vertical, closed position. Now pesticide movement is completely blocked. This is a good time to look at that control handle, where the stop switch and throttle are located. This allows the operator to control the machine without taking it off his shoulders.",
  "The backpack sprayer engine, like a lawn-mower engine, is started with a pull-cord. Set the stop switch to ON!. Now set the throttle to the center position. As you know, the throttle regulates the flow of fuel into the engine. Most two-cycle engines are started with the throttle in the center.",
  "If the engine has just been used and it's still warm, turn the choke to an open position. If the engine is cold, turn the choke to a closed position. The choke is a valve that controls the flow of air into the carburetor. Choking the engine is necessary because gasoline droplets don't evaporate well in a cold engine. When the choke is closed, air movement into the carburetor is restricted. This causes a partial vacuum and enriches the fuel-to-air mixture in the engine. Once the engine warms up, gasoline evaporates very easily and the choke is opened to allow a normal operating mixture of fuel and air.",
  "Once the choke is properly set, both operator and assistant put on their hearing protection and the assistant grabs the starter rope handle and quickly pulls the starter rope. Liza assures her students that this is NOT the time to demonstrate their \"Incredible Hulk\" physical strength by yanking the rope right out of the machine. No one should ever pull the rope to its furthest extent. A nice strong and controlled pull will usually do the trick.",
  "Once the engine starts, quickly turn the choke back to its open position. Remember that a closed choke won't let much air into the engine. This will stall the engine right away and foul the spark plug with fuel. If this happens, you'll also smell gasoline and old-timers like Willie will describe the engine as \"flooded\". Just disconnect the spark plug wire, then remove the spark plug and dry it off. After replacing the spark plug and connecting the plug wire, open the choke before trying to start the engine again.",

  "Maybe you're already saying to yourself, \"SO WHAT!\" What does all that power generated by this famously precise 2-cycle engine ACCOMPLISH? Well, along with producing noise and heat, that engine operates a powerful fan that creates two things, pressure used to feed liquid pesticide mix into the mist blower, and an air blast that disburses liquid and solid pesticides. Let's examine a liquid application first.",
  "Most of the time, backpack sprayers are used for liquid applications. To understand this process, you'll just follow the spray from loading to delivery. The first step is the chemical tank, where pesticides in the form of liquids, granules or dust can be loaded. The tank holds 3.6 gallons of pesticide. This tank is constructed of a strong, chemically resistant plastic, so it can't be corroded or dissolved by pesticide, and it also withstands the occasional rough handling of pest control work. Contemplating this strong and functional tank, Willie tries to forget his misguided attempt to build a practical yet stylish spray tank out of art glass. His first, but not last, accidental acrobatic stunt of the day, left poor Willie lying in a puddle of pesticide spray and very artsy looking smashed crystal.",
  "The spray tank also serves as a pressure chamber for liquid applications. Pressure is created when SOME of the air from the fan is forced into the tank. Under a normal liquid configuration, the pressure forces pesticide down through a plastic tube to the stopcock that you turned to an \"off\" position earlier. When the stopcock is opened, pesticide is carried to the end of the spray tube, where it's fed into the main air flow from the fan. The massive blast of air atomizes liquid pesticide and turns it into a fine mist. By the way, remember that pressure seeks an outlet...maybe in the form of a leak. Make sure you apply a little grease to the o-ring under the tank cap, to make it air-tight.",
  "No Narration",
  "For the benefit of students like Willie, who might need a few extra WEEKS to pick up on things. Liza traces the flow of air from the fan case into the spray tank, and then all the way out to the end of the spray tube. It’s hard to imagine the power of this air blast until you actually operate the machine. Air velocity at the end of the mist nozzle is over 200 miles per hour, enough to carry pesticide 38 feet into the air, or 40 feet horizontally. Sometimes Willie cranks up the backpack sprayer and uses it to blow leaves away from the outside of the shop instead of raking. Willie believes that only someone of his vast knowledge and superior intellect could have come up with this ingenious labor-saving scheme, but Liza thinks a demented hamster could have figured it out!",
  "Several things can be adjusted to fine-tune your mist-blower operation. The liquid hose ends in a nozzle fitted with a metering knob that adjusts pesticide flow. The knob has six positions, and in an ordinary configuration you can adjust the flow from 12 hundredths of a liter per minute, at setting one, to 1 and 8 tenths liters per minute at setting six, that’s quite a difference.",
  "The pressure pump, which comes as an optional device, mounts directly on the engine shaft of the backpack sprayer. The pump greatly increases pesticide flow to the nozzles, and thus output. This is especially useful when the operator is spraying up into trees. With the extension tube pointed up at an angle, pesticide flow is normally reduced to almost nothing, but the pressure pump overcomes gravity and allows treatment of orchard pests, or mosquito resting places.",
  "This chart from the backpack sprayer manual shows just how much discharge or flow rate is increased by the pump. In fact, this pump changes more than the flow rate, it also changes the way flow is regulated. Note that the metering knob is used to govern flow rate before the pressure pump is installed. During pump installation that metering knob is removed. At this point, flow rate is governed by using different metering nozzles. Installing the pressure pump is usually a 45 minute job for a qualified mechanic, and a 4 hour job for Willie, a man whose mechanical credo is “break and replace.” Once the machine is set up with the pressure pump, most operators prefer to leave that pump in place rather than trying to switch it out. ",
  "No Narration",
  "Another way to adjust the spray is to use the baffle screens that fit onto the end of the mist blower. Now if you’re at all like Willie, you probably think “baffle” is only a word that describes how he feels during lunch-time chess games with Liza, but baffle is also a technical term. In engineering, a baffle is described as a flat plate that controls or directs the flow of liquid or energy. There are three different baffle screens available for the backpack sprayer. The first is a tapered screen that produces a wide, dense spray pattern.",
  "The second baffle screen used on the mist blower is a deflector that sprays mist droplets at an angle. This kind of angle helps spray the underside of vegetation to kill resting mosquitoes, or lets you spray downward into thick grass where ticks live. ",
  "A third type of baffle screen splits the mist stream in half, so the intrepid operator can spray two swaths at once…pretty cool. Unfortunately for military operators, this kind of two-for-one spraying is usually agricultural. Unless you want to spray two rows of corn at the same time, you’ll never get a chance to practice this kind of application artistry.",
  "Now take a moment to review the three types of baffle screens and their uses. Would you use a baffle screen to treat trees? You were right if you said no. And what if you were treating underneath leaves of a low-growing crop?  Of course! The deflector baffle screen is specifically designed for this usage.",
  "By the way, one adjustment you DON’T want to attempt is regulating pesticide flow with the stopcock, which is only designed to be completely closed or completely open. Don’t try to use the stopcock in a partially closed position as an auxiliary control method. The metering knob or metering nozzles provide all the flow regulation you’ll need.",
  "No Narration",
  "So now you know how to start the engine, send pesticide to the mist blower, and adjust the rate of flow into the mist blower. Are you ready to go? Well, that depends. Let’s take a look at you, the operator. Once the engine is started, the operator has to hoist it on his or her back and do some spraying. Remember, this sprayer is an industrial-strength tool that can inflict heavy damage on the operator if it’s used improperly. The operator must wear all necessary protective gear  and has to be enrolled in an occupational health monitoring program that keeps track of any changes to his physical condition—especially changes caused by certain kinds of work. You don’t want to end up looking like Willie do you? Oh, sorry, I guess that was a stupid question.",
  "The backpack sprayer is almost ALWAYS used for misting. Now if you'll remember, mists are droplets of pesticide measuring between 50 and 100 microns in diameter. These small droplets are easily moved around by the slightest breath of air, and easily penetrate vegetation to kill pests hiding on the underside of leaves, like resting mosquitoes. Liza has used this type of treatment many times to kill mosquitoes on the edge of wooded areas or shrubbery and other “edge” situations where insects like to rest. A good mist treatment can provide two or three weeks with no adult mosquitoes, and those are visitors you won’t miss at all!",
  "Misting is a somewhat simple procedure. The pesticide and the air blast come together at the misting nozzle. That strong blast of air shears liquid into tiny droplets and discharges those droplets in a shotgun spray pattern out of the blowpipe. The operator can adjust the spray pattern by adjusting the collar of the misting nozzle, or changing engine speed. As engine speed goes up, fan speed increases and the air flow gets more and more intense, spraying mist droplets in a wide-angled spray far from the applicator. You can also adjust the amount of pesticide by opening or closing the volume control knob.",
  "One tried and true method for calibrating the backpack sprayer, and any application equipment with one nozzle, is to treat a known area and extrapolate from the results. For example, you might try spraying an square that measures 20 feet by 20 feet, or 400 square feet. Liza is going to demonstrate this calibration technique to her students and then make them do the same exercise in two-man teams.",
  "First of all, Liza checks over the backpack sprayer to make sure it’s properly fueled, and that the fuel cap is tightly closed. Now she fills the tank about half full of water and gets ready to strap it on. Here’s where a helper isn’t just handy, they’re ESSENTIAL. Putting a backpack sprayer on, and starting it up, is a job best done by two.  With a little assistance, Liza slides both arms through the harness straps and lifts the sprayer onto her shoulders. Once she tightens the shoulder straps, she’ll be ready to begin.",
  "Starting the backpack sprayer takes two people as well. First, Liza turns the on/off switch on her control handle to the on position and adjusts the throttle to ½ open. Her assistant opens the choke, since the engine is cold, and pulls the starter cord. After a few pulls, the sprayer is running fine and Liza’s assistant closes the choke. If Liza turns off the now warm engine, she can start it again with an open choke. Please note that both Liza and her assistant are wearing hearing protection, and Liza is wearing goggles and gloves. This machine is powerful and can be dangerous. Be careful!",
  "With the sprayer up and running, Liza adjusts the throttle to about three quarters open and adjusts the metering knob on the nozzle. The metering knob has 6 positions, going from minimum flow to maximum flow. Liza is calibrating this machine to spray heavy vegetation, a job that requires a high discharge rate, so she chooses position 5. While her assistant times her with a stopwatch, she opens the stopcock that feeds liquid into the spray nozzle and sprays that 400 square foot test area. It’s important to spray the test area while working at a normal and comfortable pace…if you CAN feel comfortable with an internal combustion engine on your back.",
  "When Liza finishes spraying, she puts the extension tube into an empty jerry can, cranks up the backpack sprayer, and sprays into the jerry can for the exact amount of time it took her to spray the test area. She doesn’t change the throttle setting or metering knob position at all. After measuring the amount of spray applied to 400 square feet, Liza has all the information she needs to calibrate the sprayer.",
  "Let’s say it takes Liza 92 seconds to spray 400 square feet. She then collects 88 ounces of water during 92 seconds. A few simple proportions gives her a lot of information. For example, at this rate of application she’ll empty the sprayer in about 8 minutes, and that’s typical for misting operations with this machine. From a practical standpoint, Liza tells her students that they can only plan on working for 8 minutes before refilling the tank.",
  "Liza also sees that she’ll apply almost 75 gallons of spray per acre, if she wants to treat an entire acre of land or water. Since  the tank only holds 3.6 gallons, that would mean she has to fill the tank 21 times! No wonder people don’t like spraying large areas with the backpack sprayer. Using the optional pressure pump can multiply those application rates.",
  "Before setting up the backpack sprayer to apply dusts and granules, think a minute. What kind of pesticide are you going to apply in granular form? Most military applicators NEVER use the granular spreading capability of the backpack sprayer, but they should. The most obvious pesticide to apply in the backpack sprayer is “Altosand,” a mixture of liquid Altosid mosquito larvacide, sand, and silica dioxide. If you’re like Willie and haven’t even HEARD of silica dioxide, it’s a material that makes wet sand more slippery, so it’s easily discharged from a spreader. It’s sold under the trade name HISEL. Of course, if you don’t have a supply of silica dioxide, the machine will spread plain dry sand.",
  "Altosand is used in floodwater mosquito breeding areas, which are lowlands subject to periodical floods and covered with lots of vegetation. Liquid applications just stick to the leaves and dry up without ever reaching the mosquito-infested water, but sand sifts right through and falls in the water, along with the powerful larvacide.",
  "Now that you’ve mixed up your Altosand, let’s configure the equipment. A granular spreader can be purchased as an accessory from the manufacturer. This spreader is inserted directly into the pesticide tank. The spreader assembly diverts air from the fan to agitate granules inside the pesticide tank. This keeps the granules from packing down and forming a lump of sand that can’t be dispersed. Granules pass through a  control valve from the backpack sprayer tank into the air flow of the fan, and then out the blowpipe. Adjusting the throttle changes the granular dispersal pattern. Adjusting the control valve, which you can do from the control handle on the blowpipe, changes the amount of pesticide discharged.",
  "Calibrating the backpack sprayer is almost exactly the same whether you’re applying mist or granules. Just treat a known area. In this case, Liza will apply sand over a 400 square foot target site while her assistant records the time it takes. After this, Liza will point the blowpipe into a collecting bag and apply sand for exactly the same period of time. After weighing the result, Liza knows just how much sand she’s applied to 400 square feet, and she can use that information to determine how much will be applied to a treatment site. The label recommends applying about 9 pounds of Altosand per acre. At that rate, how much should Liza apply to 400 square feet?",
  "A simple proportion shows Liza that she needs to apply only 0.08 pounds of Altosand to achieve the recommended rate of 9 pounds per acre. Since one pound equals 16 ounces, she can multiply 0.08 times 16 to convert this measurement to ounces. As it turns out, this rate is only equal to 1.28 ounces every 400 square feet. After Liza treats the test  area with sand, she’ll apply sand into a collection bag for exactly the period of time she took for application. If the collected sand weighs more or less than 1.28 ounces, she can adjust the control valve until she collects the right amount.",
  "One capability of the backpack sprayer that isn’t utilized by the military, is its ability to produce  NEARLY ULV-sized droplets. As you recall, ULV droplets should be in a range between 5 and 30 microns in diameter. The backpack sprayer CANNOT  produce droplets in that range, but once it's fitted with a ULV nozzle, it can produce very small-sized droplets, either with or without the optional pressure pump. Small, but still larger than 30 micron ULV droplets. In practice, most operators don’t use the pressure pump for ULV spraying, because it increases flow rate so much that the volume really isn’t very ultra low any more.",
  "The flow chart from the sprayer manual shows that ULV nozzles, along with the pressure pump, have discharge rates from 0.10 to 0.42 liters per minute. These discharge rates are almost identical to the lowest rates produced by the regular misting nozzle with no pressure pump, so you can see that the term “ultra-low-volume” might be stretching it a bit. On the other hand, if the pressure pump is attached, the ULV nozzles let an operator apply low doses of pesticide without removing the optional pump or making any other equipment changes.",
  "Once the sprayer is configured for ULV application, it’s time to calibrate. Once again, this is pretty easy once you’ve gathered a little data. First of all, you’ll need the swath width, the maximum spread of the droplets dispersed from an ultra-low-volume sprayer. Normally, this width is considered to be about 50 feet. This means that every foot of forward motion treats 50 square feet of area. So, if you happen to walk 100 ft in one minute, you’ll treat 5,000 square feet during that same minute.",
  "Think back, how far DO you walk in one minute? To be sure, you’ll have to check. Remember that 1 mile per hour is equal to 88 feet per minute. Since most people walk at 3 miles per hour, you probably walk at 3 times 88, or 264 feet per minute. At a swath width of 50 feet, this means you’ll treat 13,200 square feet during every minute of operation.",
  "Now calculate the time it will take  you to cover an acre. Divide the square feet you can spray in one minute… which is 13,200 square feet… into  43,560 square feet per acre.. the number of feet per acre. A simple calculation shows you that it will take three and three tenths minutes to spray a full acre. With this information, you can calculate the amount of pesticide you’ll apply to an acre using the 3 ULV nozzles, both with and without the optional pressure pump.",
  "As you can see, this sprayer puts out quite a lot of pesticide, even at the lowest possible ULV settings. Since the mosquito adulticides used by the military have very low application rates, like 1.5 to 3 ounces per acre, the backpack sprayer just isn’t suited for this kind of work, and of course, the droplet sizes are too large for true ULV application anyway. Liza recommends you save yourself some time when you purchase this backpack sprayer. Give the ULV kit a miss. This machine is well designed for misting and granular application, but the ULV nozzles are designed for treating vegetable crops or fruit trees planted in a row, not mosquitoes or sand flies.",
  "Most backpack sprayer operations involve liquid applications. Before applying liquid pesticides, see how well the machine performs with something safer, like tap water! Put the machine together and fill it half full of water. Look for leaks throughout the system, then crank it up and spray some of that water outdoors. Check to see if the spray pattern is even.",
  "At the end of every application, liquid or dry, it’s a good idea to triple rinse the sprayer with clean water and let it air dry. The machine itself should be stored safely out of the sun and weather in a dry storage room. No doubt this is the same way you treat your automobile. The backpack sprayer is tough, but the elements are tougher. These things aren’t cheap. Protect  your investment. Now, if you’ve run into any real problems with the unit, refer to the “troubleshooting” section of the manual. If you’re not mechanically inclined, tread softly during this troubleshooting phase. This is where one motivated and clueless applicator can really destroy a perfectly good backpack sprayer. Maybe your unit mechanic should do this kind of work, hmmm?",
  "If you’ve only been using the machine to apply dusts or granules, daily cleanup is just a little different. Wash up the machine and rinse it with water in the same way, but use non-pesticide granules, like kitty litter, to check your distribution pattern. You won’t be using the misting nozzles or liquid feed pipe.",
  "Once every month or so, depending on the level of usage, it's time to really clean up that sprayer. For this task you'll want some ordinary detergent and some rubber gloves to guard against dishpan hands, and an ordinary cleaning brush. Wash and rinse the tank, the strainer and the misting nozzle. If you've been doing a good job rinsing the machine with water after every use, this monthly cleanup will be a snap. If you're like Willie, a man who drives through mud puddles to \"wash\" his car, it may take longer.",
  "In an ideal world, everyone would clean their backpack sprayer on a monthly basis, but in the real world, that MIGHT not happen. Luckily for all of you who didn't make your employer's MOST DILIGENT list, this machine can be left in storage indefinitely, IF it's properly cleaned and all the gasoline is removed by running the engine until fuel is exhausted. Willie for example, quietly stored away his sprayer in 1970, and it would probably still work fine. ",
  "After cleaning out the spray tank, you should wash off the outside of the sprayer with soapy water. These machines can get a little oily after use, and soap will take care of that problem. After it’s clean, let the machine dry off, put it back together and crank it up.",
  "If you haven’t used the sprayer for a long time, it’s a good idea now, while it’s running, to spray some water. This will remove any crystallized gunk that you SHOULD have rinsed out after the last operation. Just spray half a tank of clean water through the machine, then let it dry and put it back into storage.",
  "If the backpack sprayer doesn’t immediately crank up when you pull the starter rope, don’t panic. Remember your dad and his lawn mower? Two-cycle engines are simple and reliable, but they seem to enjoy, in a metallic sort of way, pulling our chain. A little troubleshooting can sometimes save you a humiliating trip to the mechanic. Here’s an idea! Why don’t you take a look at the manual before you break out the ball-peen hammer?",
  "Quite often, the operator doesn’t ever get past the all-important “start the engine” stage, and that’s WAY too often his or her own fault. Before giving up on an engine that won’t crank, check out some basic stuff. For example, is there any fuel in the tank? Have you connected the spark plug? Is any air actually getting into the engine?",
  "Remember Willie’s hapless attempts to start the sprayer engine? Think about things like closing the choke on a cold engine, or putting the throttle in a “half open” position. If nothing else seems to work, mechanically-minded operators can remove the spark plug and re-set the gap to manufacturer’s standards. Again, if you’re the kind of person who can’t figure out which end of a screwdriver is the handle, leave this to your mechanic.",
  "Now, if the engine starts, but runs roughly because of an unstable combustion process, the problem might well be an incorrect mixture of air and fuel. Did you leave the choke in a closed position after the engine started? Is the air filter so dirty that air can’t get through? Is the choke lever so loose that it opens and closes the choke during operation? Some of these problems can be handled by the operator. In other cases, some mechanical expertise may be required.",
  "Some problems with combustion may involve the spark the engine needs to operate, or the fuel itself. Possibly the spark plug or spark plug wire is damaged, or maybe the fuel to oil ratio is incorrect. Most of us can fix this kind of problem, given sufficient time and an equipment manual. If you suspect the engine is seriously damaged, seek out the mechanic and let him diagnose the cause.",
  "For lots of smaller jobs, there is an alternative to the gasoline-powered backpack sprayer--the hand-pressurized backpack sprayer. Oddly enough, Willie, that self-styled encyclopedia of pest management knowledge, has never used the gasoline powered backpack sprayer, except during training. He much prefers the hand-pump device, a machine that lets him walk happily along humming something from “Rigoletto” and killing pests with a low-pressure spray. This machine definitely has its place in outdoor pesticide application. Willie has used it to apply herbicides, insecticides and fungicides, with never a breakdown or malfunction, and almost no sound to disturb the self-styled opera aficionados of the pest management world.",
  "The manual backpack sprayer is basically a compressed-air sprayer with an important improvement, since the operator can pump and spray at the same time, he never has to stop working to pump up the tank again. That  continuous pumping also develops more pressure than you can easily store in a compressed-air sprayer, so pesticide flow and range of spray is greater. Of course, the pressure isn’t truly uniform, because pressure surges every time you push down on the pump handle—but it’s uniform enough. For outdoor applications on turf or shrubbery, where limited application rates are sufficient, this machine is tough to beat.",
  "As far as calibration goes, you’ve heard this song before. Just spray a known area and time the operation, then use that data to determine how much spray you’d apply to a target. It’s simple.",
  "Using the manual backpack sprayer is a cinch if it’s kept clean and free of gunk. Just rinse it with clean water after every use, let it air dry, and store it in a clean place with no sunshine to crack rubber hoses or o-rings. A little oil on those rings keeps them nice and flexible.",
  "Poor Lisa, she’s completely finished talking about the Army’s backpack sprayer, and she has a happy audience of young Soldiers who know how to do something absolutely new and different. Now it’s Miller time, right? Wrong! As it turns out, the Army uses a few other pieces of pesticide application equipment. So it’s time for Liza to start all over again. Stay tuned!",
  "This concludes the lesson. You should now take a moment to review the printable key points document. Key points documents for each lesson are available from the OPTIONS menu. You may also wish to review glossary terms before proceeding with the knowledge check.",
