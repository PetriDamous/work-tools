/*1*/"No Narration",
/*2*/"Have you ever sprayed weed killer on your lawn and then worried about the neighborhood animals? <i>(You wondered if cats and dogs might play on the lawn and get sick, and what about wild animals like squirrels?)</i> Watched a mosquito fogger come down the street and wondered how birds can live in that cloud of pesticide?  <i>(You wondered if insecticides have any effect on other animals.)</i> Asked the pest controller if all pesticides are safe for children?  <i>(You already lock up cleaning supplies away from the kids, so how can spraying pesticides in the house be okay?)</i> Thought about buying organic vegetables to avoid eating pesticides?  <i>(You wonder if eating pesticide- treated fruits and vegetables might harm your health.)</i>",
/*3*/"Take a moment to look over the lesson objectives.",
/*4*/"On an average morning, Skeeter and Willie don't think that much about environmental problems, but this morning <i>isn't</i> ordinary, and the boys will soon know <i>all</i> about pesticides and the environment.  <b>The day starts being out of the ordinary from the very start, when...</b> Skeeter and Willie pull their truck to an abrupt halt.  They've just spotted Cornelia Wintergreen, ace environmentalist, scouting out a field on Fort Runamok, and she sees THEM!  Moments later our heroes are driving stakes into the hard ground, marking out spots for tree plantings. Cornelia has a new plan to save birds!!",
/*5*/"Skeeter and Willie learn that migratory birds have suffered a population decline, lately, due possibly to habitat loss.  These birds need large, unbroken areas of trees and nowadays large open green areas are hard to come by.  Cornelia's campaign to plant large tracts of green space may help restore these dwindling migratory birds. Willie suddenly has a clever idea!  To irritate stone-faced Cornelia, he says, \"Ma'am I don't know if you realize this...\" But before he can finish, Cornelia, who has <i>long</i> and <i>weary</i> experience with these jokes, interrupts to say, \"No Willie, they DON'T taste like chicken. And that's not very funny!\"  The guys realize too late, that Cornelia Wintergreen does not make jokes about serious ecological issues.  \"Way to go, Willie,\"  whispers Skeeter, \"we'll be planting trees for the next five years!\"",
/*6*/"No Narration",
/*7*/"Later on, much later in Willie's opinion, a calmer Cornelia tells Skeeter and Willie more about her project.  She's secured funding to plant trees and otherwise encourage migratory bird populations on the installation.  She's also started to wonder about the pesticides that Skeeter and Willie have been using on the installation.  Skeeter doesn't understand Cornelia's concern at all.  He and Willie don't go around trying to kill migratory birds!  Of course, Cornelia knows our heroes would never kill a non-target species, but as history shows, it's all too easy to accidentally harm birds and other species during pesticide applications.  In fact, Cornelia has studied many cases in which pesticides have killed birds, contaminated water or soil, and caused widespread environmental damage.",
/*8*/"Cornelia thinks about environmental protection...<i>a lot.</i>  But she doesn't stand alone on this issue. DoD has made the environment a priority by establishing the, so-called \"conservation pillars,\"  which seek to protect threatened and endangered species, fish and wildlife, clean air, clean water and even cultural resources, such as historic landmarks.  The commander of each installation implements the 5 pillars of conservation through specialists like Cornelia.",
/*9*/"How do pesticides fit into the environmental conservation effort?  You might have heard that pesticides pose a serious threat to the world we live in. Most people have heard of DDT, Agent Orange, and few people have even read marine biologist, Rachel Carson's book, <u>The Silent Spring,</u> an expose of DDT.  Most people know these terms refer to some kind of environmental damage and they may believe the same kind of damage goes on today. They might buy organic vegetables to avoid eating pesticide residue, or they might even believe that pesticides constitute the main risk to the health of the environment.  We'll be looking into these claims along with Skeeter and Willie. ",
/*10*/"No Narration",
/*11*/"Unfortunately, a common effect of pesticide misuse is damage to animal populations.  Skeeter and Willie  don't want to harm wild animals, at all.  Despite his cynical exterior, Willie has logged hundreds of miles driving wounded animals to the Wildlife Rescue Center, and Skeeter secretly raises baby songbirds that have fallen out of the nest, but they both know that pesticides can harm wildlife, especially birds and fish; birds, because of their small size and feeding habits. They tend to eat granules and sometimes poisoned insects.  Fish are vulnerable because of their exposure to contaminated waters.",
/*12*/"Since birds have no teeth, they swallow pebbles to help grind up their food. When a bird eats, it's food is ground up between stones in the crop, a muscular digestive organ. The problem is that pesticide granules look just like pebbles!  Chicken farmers actually put out trays of tiny gravel chips for their chickens to eat.  The problem is that birds seek out pesticide granules, mistaking them for the pebbles that they use to help grind up their food.  Birds can also come into contact with pesticides by drinking or bathing in pesticide contaminated water.  For example, after a rainstorm, birds might bathe in a puddle downhill from a pesticide-treated field. ",
/*13*/"Almost everyone has heard of DDT, the insecticide that put environmental harm on the map!  Originally, if you can believe it, this stuff was hugely popular because it was highly effective in killing bugs back in the 1940's, thus, saving our troops from arthropod-borne diseases, caused mainly by mosquitoes and ticks. By the 1950's and into the sixties, scientists had turned DDT into a peacetime, malaria-fighting pesticide, nearly eradicating malaria in tropical countries across the world. Dr. Paul Muller received the Nobel Prize in 1948 for his wartime work with DDT.  So, why in the world does this miracle-working chemical have such a horrible reputation?",
/*14*/"As it turns out, everyone noticed that DDT kills insects, including farmers around the world.  In an unwise move that seemed clever at first, farmers and everyone else started <i>inexpertly</i> using and overusing DDT to control every conceivable kind of pest.  By 1962, <u>The Silent Spring</u>, which documented DDT-related environmental damage, drove the nails into the coffin of this misunderstood chemical.  DDT went from public health miracle to environmental disaster in less than 2 decades and was banned.",
/*15*/"Despite all the miraculous properties of DDT, the compound had an Achilles heel...persistence.  Although public health workers loved the persistence of DDT on the walls and ceilings of mosquito-infested houses, wildlife biologists hated the persistence of a chemical that stays, and <i>stays</i> in the environment for years to come. Worse still, since animals cannot easily excrete fat-soluble DDT, it remains in the body to cause possible long-term health effects.",
/*16*/"No Narration",
/*17*/"Most people now remember DDT because of it's effect on birds of prey, especially our national emblem, the Bald Eagle.  Through a complex process, DDT accumulates in predators like the Brown Pelican and Bald Eagle and causes reproductive problems, such as eggshell thinning.  With eagle reproduction declining and the species apparently on the brink of disaster, EPA had little choice but to ban DDT in 1972.  It seems that many pesticides affect fish and birds, particularly fish and birds and other animals that feed or live in water, far more than other groups of animals.",
/*18*/"Modern insecticides, especially synthetic organophosphates and carbamates took the place of DDT.  Ironically, these pesticides are, if anything, more deadly to fish and birds, but in a different way.  Whereas DDT and it's evil cousins caused reproductive problems because of persistence, the newer insecticides tend to kill outright, without being persistent. ",
/*19*/"No Narration",
/*20*/"Which group of animals is more vulnerable to pesticide exposure?  It turns out that almost any animals living in an aquatic or wetland habitats suffer more from pesticide exposure than animals living on dry land. Why?  Primarily because wetland organisms absorb so much <i>more</i> pesticide from water.  Most pesticides tend to concentrate in water because rainfall washes it down-hill from crops and soil.",
/*21*/"Even when wild animals aren't immediately killed by pesticide exposure, the pesticides do NOT make them feel refreshed and ready to face another day!  Animals don't have to die to be removed from the population.  In the natural world, success means reproduction, and pesticides do not enhance success.  As mentioned earlier, pesticides might cause reproductive problems, like the eggshell-thinning associated with DDT.  In addition, small animals exposed to nervous system toxins, such as organophosphate insecticides, can suffer brain chemistry imbalances, leading to an inability to feed, seek shelter, or migrate.",
/*22*/"No Narration",
/*23*/"In addition to harming individual wild animals, poorly handled pesticides, especially herbicides, have the potential to harm entire ecosystems!  Pesticides can remove a vital community of living things.  It is not good for the ecosystem when native predators and parasites are eliminated because they normally keep the ecological balance and provide natural controls against pests.  This process of removing a vital element of the ecosystem is known as <i>biotic simplification.</i>",
/*24*/"You may be wondering why the elimination of a pest does not represent a devastating loss to a given ecosystem.  The answer is that most pests, imports from other ecosystems, are actually destabilizing to their adoptive ecosystem.  Thus, removing them usually improves overall health of the living community.",
/*25*/"Cornelia wants Skeeter and Willie to mount an immediate \"take no prisoners\" attack on a small patch of musk thistle, an aggressive European plant that she just found on Fort Runamok.  Ecologist Willie, however, objects that plants provide food and shelter for wildlife and he doesn't want to disrupt the food chain.  Something in Cornelia's look brings him stammering to a halt.",
/*26*/"No Narration",
/*27*/"Have you ever thrown a stone into a body of water and watched the concentric ripples that form in rapid succession on the water's surface?  The stone triggers a chain of events, one following another.  Since an ecosystem is a living community, a change to one part inevitably impacts on the whole.  An example of a positive ripple effect is the establishment of \"no-fishing\" areas in the North Atlantic to allow codfish and haddock populations to recover from over-use.  Now the fish are more numerous, and larger.  Cod and haddock feed on shellfish, crabs, anemones, worms and other creatures of the sea floor, so those populations are impacted, as are the organisms they eat; one action, the \"no fishing zone\", many effects.",
/*28*/"Biotic simplification may trigger a ripple effect.  For example, herbicides kill plants, and plants provide food and shelter for living things throughout the living community.  Losing large numbers of native trees, shrubs, or herbs, for example, decreases soil organisms, such as earthworms, and thus decreases the soil's water-holding capacity, which may have many other unforeseen effects on the ecosystem;  thus, the ripple effect--all deriving from the original act of simplification.  Similarly, the target of a pesticide application may be a pest weed, like dandelion.  But an unexpected ripple effect may be the loss of beneficial broad-leaf plants, leading to a smaller seed crop and declining populations of small mammals and birds.",
/*29*/"Fungicides used to control plant disease, such as rust fungi, also kill beneficial soil microbes, thus, disrupting the delicate balance of soil ecology.  Most people don't realize that most of the world's living things inhabit the topsoil, so these living communities have vital importance.  Soil organisms perform a huge variety of essential functions in the ecosystem, including decay of organic materials and nutrient recycling.",
/*30*/"Insecticides applied outdoors don't just kill pest insects.  They can easily kill beneficial insects, even the predators and parasites actually <i>needed</i> to help control the pests. What's more, many times pests have a much higher reproductive rate than beneficial insects, with a net effect that the ecosystem ends up with more pests than were initially present.",
/*31*/"No Narration",
/*32*/"Sometimes pesticide use may result in an imbalance in the ecosystem and the loss of natural controls.  For example, pesticides may zap native predators and parasites who normally keep pest species in check, with the unfortunate result that the ecosystem ends up with <i>more total pests than before.</i>  This is a consequence of biological simplification- simplifying the ecosystem causes an imbalance.",
/*33*/"Another problem resulting from ecological imbalance, is that of emergent (or secondary) pest</a>. Sometimes controlling one pest, leads to a problem with another previously minor and unnoticed pest.  This type of imbalance occurs between two pests who normally compete for the same food source.  Emergent or secondary pests, the ecological \"wannabee's,\" suddenly emerge from obscurity after the primary pest has been eliminated.  It happens like this.  Pests A %26 B normally compete for the same food within a given ecosystem. When Pest A is eliminated as a result of a pesticide application, pest B emerges as the new problem and has a field day, aggressively monopolizing the food source. Pest B is now the emergent or secondary pest, the former ecological \"wannabee,\" having emerged from obscurity to take center stage as the king of the heap after the primary pest has been eliminated.",
/*34*/"Elimination of the Boll Weevil from a cotton field resulted in an emergent or secondary pest problem with the Pink Boll worm.  The Boll Weevil, the blight of the cotton crop, was the fastest gun in it's ecological system, able to do the most damage, because it was able to reproduce at an amazing rate and monopolize the food source (cotton).  When the Boll Weevil was wiped out, a temporary ecological vacuum was created. That void was soon filled by the Pink Boll worm, the heretofore, <i>second</i> fastest gun and <i>\"wannabee\"</i> within the ecological system. With its main competition, the Boll Weevil, under control, the Pink Boll worm emerged as the new and significant pest problem.",
/*35*/"No Narration",
/*36*/"No one likes to see a secondary poisoning of non-target fauna occur, but it sometimes happens anyway.  Secondary poisoning means that the poisoned pest gets eaten by another animal who is, in turn, itself poisoned.  For example, a cat or predatory bird might eat a mouse that had just consumed a rodenticide. The poison might then claim a secondary victim, the cat or bird.",
/*37*/"No Narration",
/*38*/"Finally, some pesticides can move through the food web of an ecosystem and instead of becoming more dilute, they become even more concentrated!  This phenomenon is known as biomagnification,  since the pesticide seems to magnify as it moves higher up through the food web. Biomagnification is especially associated with chlorinated hydrocarbons, such as DDT and chlordane, the persistent pesticides.  These pesticides dissolve and absorb readily into fat (but not water). Water-soluble pesticides pass through animals via the urinary tract, whereas DDT is actually stored in the body fat, where it tenaciously remains.  Like cannibals who consumed their enemy's heart for sustenance and to absorb the enemy's courage, predators consume DDT along with the animals they eat and move the pesticide up along the food web as other animals higher up in the web absorb the pesticide, in turn, in the food they eat.",
/*39*/"Back at the office, Skeeter wants to know if people carry any DDT stored in their bodies, leading evil Willie to remark that Skeeter could store a bag of DDT just above his belt! The fact of the matter is that people all over the world do carry DDT in body fat due to bio-magnification.  Even human breast milk still contains DDT.",
/*40*/"No Narration",
/*41*/"Poor Skeeter, he just came off second in a shootout with a wasp colony and now writhes in agony while the wasps exchange high fives and laugh it up!  At this moment, Skeeter could easily crank up the hydraulic sprayer and destroy every wasp nest on Ft. Runamok!",
/*42*/"No Narration",
/*43*/"Willie just set up to treat some lawns up near headquarters, when he notices some cats lounging out in the sunshine and enjoying life just a little too much.  Willie, a man whose love for cats is WELL-concealed, toys with the idea of disturbing their smug napping with a cold bath of water and herbicide.",
/*44*/"No Narration",
/*45*/"To her surprise, Cornelia learns a lot about pesticides from Skeeter and Willie. For example, she hears about the most bizarre incidents involving pets and livestock.  In fact, these almost fearless guys have always had a healthy fear of pet owners, and  would do anything to avoid angering them.  Did you know that applying pesticides indoors can affect house pets, including caged birds and even the fish in your aquarium.  Cornelia wonders how the guys learned about this kind of mishap, but Skeeter and Willie only mumble about \"some old fella we used to know!\"",
/*46*/"Domestic animals can come into contact with pesticides by playing on a lawn or chewing on grass after a pesticide treatment.  Sometimes animals will eat food or drink water that has somehow become contaminated, and cattle or horses might graze on weeds that have just been doused with herbicide.",
/*47*/"People can sometimes come into contact with pesticide residues on food. Washing and peeling produce removes nearly all pesticide residues.  Human contact can also occur when pesticide vapors are inhaled, especially after an indoor treatment.  Open windows to let the house air out for an hour after pesticide treatments.  Contaminated water is another means of exposure for humans.  Though the EPA regulates contaminant levels and requires constant monitoring to control any threat to public health, tiny quantities of pesticides sometimes turn up in drinking water. For added protection, invest in a charcoal filter that allows your tap water to filter one more time.  Finally, the family dog or cat might track in pesticide residues from the yard. Of course, children may roll around on the grass with  the dog or cat and come inside covered with grass stains and pesticides, as well. Keep pets and children indoors for 2 hours after treatment and wash pets regularly.",
/*48*/"Of course, the worst environmental nightmare involves exposing people, especially children.  The exposure of children is of particular concern because they're smaller and their little bodies and brains are still under development...  The newspapers often feature tales of terrible incidents involving accidental exposure to pesticides, and in every case, those pesticides have fallen into the hands of untrained people.  Don't use pesticides in ways not intended.  People shouldn't wear pet collars.  Duh!",
/*49*/"Once upon a time, of course, we treated people very directly with insecticides like DDT.  Although this sounds horrifying now, remember that DDT doesn't seem to have caused any immediate harm, and it killed mosquitoes that carry diseases like malaria and dengue fever.  Nowadays the common sense precaution taken is to strenuously avoid treating anyone with pesticides, except when a doctor has given a prescription for something like shampoo for head lice.",
/*50*/"No Narration",
/*51*/"Unfortunately, water supplies all over the world, including the United States, contain small amounts of pesticide. Sometimes, the level of pesticides in drinking water forces authorities to declare water unfit for human consumption.  In the United States, wells contaminated with atrazine, an herbicide used in Midwestern soybean and corn fields, have been closed.  Willie finds it hard to believe, but, in fact, pesticide applicators have themselves contaminated groundwater supplies through acts of almost inconceivable goofiness, like allowing pesticides to siphon back into open wells.  DUH! ",
/*52*/"Since wells and springs offer a direct \"window\" into groundwater, to avoid ground water contamination, avoid spraying near wells and springs at all costs. And, of course, as stated, beware of allowing pesticides to siphon into open wells",
/*53*/"Earlier Skeeter heard Cornelia when she said that most pesticides end up in water, so that any animals (wildlife) in aquatic or wetland habitats are exposed to more pesticides than animals living on dry land. Pesticides can get into water systems through runoff, contaminated drinking or washing water, drift, on the wings of water fowl, or airborne droplets.",
/*54*/"Runoff is the principal means by which pesticides enter the water system and come into contact with wildlife, This often happens when pesticides wash down slopes during a rainstorm.  Pesticides can also drift through the air on a windy day as airborne vapors or droplets.  They can even be carried on the wings of aquatic fowl. Many years ago, researchers studying DDT, found that ducks flying from one DDT-treated pond to another untreated pond, carried enough DDT on their feathers to kill mosquito larvae in the untreated pond. Regulators instantly suspect a pesticide spill when a fish kill occurs, and they look for it.",
/*55*/"No Narration",
/*56*/"Such a laundry list of environmental damage could convince almost anyone to stop using pesticides forever!  In fact, environmentalist, Cornelia has already started  wondering how she can phase out the pest control program and ease Skeeter and Willie into a genteel retirement for the good for Fort Runamok!  The panic-stricken twosome, now facing unemployment, rush to reassure Cornelia that pest management doesn't have to  damage the environment.",
/*57*/"Skeeter and Willie might stand up for their fellow-pesticide applicators over some of these problems.  How could they control someone's dog or cat, or the children who play on a lawn?  On the other hand, a lot of pesticide mishaps have resulted from pure carelessness.  Pesticide applicators must take responsibility for controlling the factors that are within their control.  So what is under your control?  You can completely control the type of pesticide you apply for the job, the dosage, the formulation, the mode of application, and the area you treat.  Do not fail to do the things you can do to protect the environment.",
/*58*/"Willie stands on the edge of a little pond on Ft. Runamok.  He's received some complaints about mosquitoes, and he actually SEES mosquito larvae swimming around in the pond.  Willie only has some pyrethroid insecticide on hand, not labeled for aquatic use, but he wonders, could it really do any harm?",
/*59*/"No Narration",
/*60*/"Although you can't control the weather, you must plan applications based on weather conditions. Failure to take the wind into account probably causes more pesticide mishaps than any other single factor.  When pesticides begin to drift away from the treatment site, stop the application. A good rule of thumb is to stop spraying whenever wind speed exceeds five miles per hour. Rainfall also moves a lot of pesticide off target, either through runoff or percolation. Runoff  occurs when pesticides wash across the ground in rainwater.  Rain may also cause percolation when pesticides wash down through sandy soil into underground water supplies.   To avoid runoff, apply pesticide when rain is not expected for at least a day. To avoid percolation, choose your pesticide properly if working on sandy soil because not all pesticides percolate or move through soil to the same degree.",
/*61*/"This graphic summarizes how the forces of nature combined with poor planning can lead to misapplication and environmental contamination.  The nozzle, upper left, shows a pesticide spray being released.  Just then the wind picks up and causes airborne pesticide droplets and vapors to drift into the air.  Rain begins to fall and in the lower right you see rain starting to runoff to a non-target site.  Underneath the surface of the earth, sandy soil allows some pesticide to percolate or leach down into groundwater, while some pesticide degrades or breaks down into inert compounds.  Virtually all of this can be avoided by following precautions about weather.",
/*62*/"No Narration",
/*63*/"The job is only half done once the pesticide has been applied. Anyone who uses pesticide must store materials safely and ensure proper disposal of empty containers. If storage and disposal are neglected, environmental contamination occurs.",
/*64*/"At one time people stored pesticides almost any old place: on wooden shelves, or exposed to sunlight and outdoor temperatures, or in unventilated areas.  Thank goodness most people know better now!  Pesticides should stay intact and in the storage area.  They should have stored on impermeable flooring and shelving.  On the edge of the flooring and shelving there should be a barrier for spill-containment.  The area should also be cool and dark to prevent damage to pesticides.  The untreated concrete of a garage or sidewalk is NOT a good place to store pesticides. Concrete must be treated with epoxy, an impermeable material that resists chemical breakdown.   No wonder the EPA only allows the general public to buy relatively safe pesticides at the hardware store, an added insurance against the unwanted spill or mishap. ",
/*65*/"Of course, pesticides poured into an unlabeled container, immediately become WAY too dangerous.  Skeeter has seen soft-drink or juice bottles used to mix pesticides!  What keeps a child from drinking out of that \"soda\" bottle?",
/*66*/"Just making a handwritten note on a bottle used to store pesticide does NOT constitute a label.  A pest controller can so easily lose track of these unlabeled containers, and then, look out, anything can happen! ",
/*67*/"No Narration",
/*68*/"Sometimes a fire in a pesticide storage facility will release a LOT of pesticide to the environment, and that release happens fast!  Often, firefighters trying to contain the blaze will use water on the fire, and that tends to spread contamination by washing pesticides across the ground.  In a very hot fire, most of the pesticide may burn up.",
/*69*/"The trained applicator triple rinses all empty pesticide containers, then punctures the container and disposes of it by recycling, or in a landfill or offers the intact container to the manufacturer for recycling.  When untrained personnel fail to clean and dispose pesticide containers, the left-over pesticide concentrate becomes a hazard. ",
/*70*/"Early one morning, Skeeter had just finished fogging for mosquitoes, and found, to his dismay, some leftover insecticide.  Skeeter felt baffled until he caught sight of a nearby grove. A light went on his fertile mind!  Why not discharge the insecticide into the trees instead of retreating the original area? ",
/*71*/"No Narration",
/*72*/"A lot of environmental problems caused by pesticides don't show up until long after the original application.  In these cases, the happy applicator has already forgotten about the work he once did, and he may never realize that the residue of the pesticide he once applied has caused so much trouble. ",
/*73*/"Old-time pesticides, because of their chemical structure,are very persistent. They just don't break down very quickly, so that their residues can cause trouble for years, and YEARS to come!  Chlorinated hydrocarbons, like DDT and chlordane have become famous for longevity.  Worse yet, some persistent chemicals can move all over the world in wind, rain, and river or ocean currents.  Years ago, Willie even heard that scientists found DDT in fish swimming under the Antarctic ice cap, thousands of miles from any DDT usage!  In a particularly nasty trick, some of these persistent chemicals break down to something MORE toxic.  Fortunately, modern pesticides tend to break down far more quickly than those notorious bug-stoppers of the past!  Environmental forces, such as: sunlight, oxidation, hydrolysis (combination with water), acid or alkaline soil or water conditions, and even microbes break down these fragile modern molecules.",

/*75*/"Cornelia has found out something important about the environmental damage done by pesticides. Namely, it's EASY to talk about protecting the environment, but tough to actually DO something... She feels most interested in making sure NONE of that damage occurs on Fort Runamok.  How in the world will Skeeter and Willie insure that their pesticides just kill pests and don't end up in the water, or on the feed being eaten by a bird?  Here's where Skeeter and Willie know exactly how to proceed.  Willie tries to imitate a hard-boiled movie detective by saying, \"pest control is my business, ma'am,\" but Cornelia just wonders, \"what in the world?\"",
/*76*/"Ultra-confident Willie explains that he and Skeeter protect the environment by carefully choosing the safest pesticides, using less pesticide, and avoiding trouble spots.  For example, they avoid using dust formulations in areas where bees forage, or granules to golf courses or other places where seed-eating birds may feed, or putting ANY pesticide in places that the label doesn't allow.  They also try to use the LEAST toxic pesticides and the minimum dosage.  In addition, they encourage their boss to constantly upgrade pesticide application equipment because modern equipment does the same job more efficiently and accurately, using less pesticide, so contamination is minimized.  \"You've probably already forgotten all about this stuff, ma'am,\" he blithely tells Cornelia, earning himself a flash of white-hot anger from the formidable environmentalist! ",
/*77*/"No Narration",
/*78*/"Willie and Skeeter are button-busting proud of their ability to use very little pesticide and still get the job done. \"How do we do it?\"  Willie asks rhetorically.  Well, it's actually quite an accomplishment.  The duo manages this feat by detailed surveillance of every site to FIND pests, and by treating only heavily populated areas.  In addition, Willie has developed quite a skill at timing applications against outdoor pests so they really do the job, usually by treating pests when they're small and vulnerable.  He and Skeeter also faithfully rotate chemicals to avoid buildup of pesticide resistance. ",
/*79*/"A facility that is well-maintained will normally NOT  have significant pest control problems.  Our dynamic duo uses practical non-chemical controls, whenever possible, and it's always possible.  In fact, vengeful Skeeter cannot help gloating every time he forces a building occupant to control pests by CLEANING UP, or points out a structural problem, such as the need for a physical barrier or caulking, at the heart of a pest infestation.  Similarly, golf course wizard Willie would much prefer to use  a biological approach--predatory nematodes against mole crickets and lady-bird beetles to eat aphids, than pesticides.  Note that a non-chemical approach is superior because applying no pesticide is better for the environment than applying some pesticide.",
/*80*/"No Narration",
/*81*/"Lastly, Skeeter and Willie avoid a few areas of Fort Runamok, like the plague!  The idea of putting pesticides into schools, child care centers, wetlands, or anywhere near drinking water supplies, scares these tough guys out of a night's sleep!  Then too, they won't even LOOK at the protected species areas Cornelia has pointed out to them...they well remember her forceful way of POINTING things out!  In addition, Willie has learned, he won't say exactly HOW, to keep away from streams and lakes when applying pesticides outdoors.  That pesticide-free \"buffer zone\" really helps keep pesticides out of water.   Cornelia feels satisfied, for now.  The environment of Fort Runamok is in safe hands.  She waves a cheery goodbye, while Willie mutters, again, \"What next?\"  Well, STAY TUNED!!",
/*82*/"Poor Willie, he's answered a distress call at the child care center and walked right into a hornet's nest...REALLY! A hornet has stung one of the students, who's yelling like mad, and MOM has arrived.  She blames Willie for not taking care of this problem before it happened.  She screams, \"Where were you last WEEK?\"  Willie was actually fishing last week, but he won't admit it.  Now he'd better take care of this problem FAST!  He reaches for the spray gun, then hesitates... You just know Willie will do the right thing, but what's your advice?",

/*86*/"Pesticide usage got off to a rocky start during the 20th century.  Pesticides that seemed like miracles ended up as disasters and the public still remembers those disasters. Fortunately, modern chemistry has produced pesticides of incredible safety and efficiency that will NOT  harm the environment when properly used.  Remember that many pests are alien to their current ecosystem and act as living hazards to the environment, a hazard you use pesticides to control.",
